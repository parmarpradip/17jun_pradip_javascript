        <h2>Question-17 : What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Security Risks (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):</b></p>
            <p>Directly manipulating innerHTML with user-generated content or untrusted data can lead to security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site 
            Scripting (XSS).</p>
         <p> If unvalidated user input is injected into the innerHTML, it may execute malicious scripts.</p>


        <p><b>Performance Implications:</b></p>
              <p>Changing the innerHTML property of an element involves parsing and re-rendering the entire content of the element.</p> 
              <p>If you are making frequent updates to a large portion of the page, it may have performance implications compared to more targeted manipulation methods.</p>
    
        <p><b>Event Handlers:</b></p>
        <p>When you use innerHTML to replace or update the content of an element, any existing event handlers attached to child elements are lost, and you'll need to 
            reattach them</p>
