        <h2>Question 7 : What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>
        <hr>

        <p><b>ViewState:</b><br>
                <p><b>Scope:</b> ViewState is used to persist data across postbacks for a single page.</p>
                <p><b>Storage:</b> The data is stored as a hidden field in the page itself. It is sent to the client browser and returned to the server
                 with each postback.</p>
                <p><b>Size Limitations:</b> Since ViewState is sent to the client, it is typically limited by the size of a page. Storing large 
                amounts of data in ViewState can impact page load times.</p>
                <p><b>Security:</b> While the data is encoded, it is not meant for secure storage. Sensitive information should not be stored in ViewState.</p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>SessionState:</b><br>   
                <p><b>Scope:</b> SessionState is used to persist data across multiple requests for a user during their entire session on the 
                    website.</p>
                <p><b>Storage:</b> The data is stored on the server, and a session identifier is sent to the client. The server uses this 
                    identifier to associate the client with its session data.</p>
                <p><b>Size Limitations:</b> SessionState can typically store larger amounts of data compared to ViewState. However, the server's 
                    available memory and configuration settings can impose limits.</p>
                <p><b>Security:</b> SessionState is generally more secure than ViewState for storing sensitive information because the data 
                    is kept on the server.</p>
