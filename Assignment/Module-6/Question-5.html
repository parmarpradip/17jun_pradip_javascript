        <h2>Question 5 : What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> 
         1.Undeclared Variables: <br>

           An undeclared variable is a variable that has not been explicitly declared using a declaration statement, such as `var`, `let`, or
            `const`, before it is used. <br>
         <b>ex:</b>
        <br>
          console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
       <br><br>
      
         2.Undefined Variables: <br>

         An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It exists in the program's scope, 
         but it doesn't have a defined value yet. <br>
         <b>ex:</b>
        <br>
           var y; <br>
           console.log(y); // undefined
        </p>
